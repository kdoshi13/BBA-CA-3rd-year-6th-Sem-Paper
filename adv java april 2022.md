Q1.
1) what is the use of cookies
=)
A cookie is a small piece of information that is persisted between the multiple client requests.A cookie has a name, a single value, and optional attributes such as a comment, path and domain qualifiers, a maximum age, and a version number.

2) what is the use of runnable interface?
=)
The Runnable interface in Java is used to:

Define a task or unit of work that can be executed asynchronously.
Create and start a new thread of execution.
Encapsulate code and promote code organization and reusability.
Enable parallel execution of tasks, handling multiple requests or time-consuming operations.
Facilitate the sharing of resources between threads.
Integrate with Java's concurrency utilities like ExecutorService and ThreadPoolExecutor.
Execute code concurrently without blocking the main thread.
Implement the run() method to define the code that will be executed by the thread.
Pass shared objects or data structures to the Runnable instance for manipulation.
Enable better control and management of threads and thread pools.

3) Explain thread priority.
=)
Each thread has a priority. Priorities are represented by a number between 1 and 10. In most cases, the thread scheduler schedules the threads according to their priority (known as preemptive scheduling). But it is not guaranteed because it depends on JVM specification that which scheduling it chooses. Note that not only JVM a Java programmer can also assign the priorities of a thread explicitly in a Java program.

4) What is the use of HQL?
=)
Hibernate Query Language (HQL) is an object-oriented query language, similar to SQL, but instead of operating on tables and columns, HQL works with persistent objects and their properties. HQL queries are translated by Hibernate into conventional SQL queries, which in turns perform action on database.

Although you can use SQL statements directly with Hibernate using Native SQL, but I would recommend to use HQL whenever possible to avoid database portability hassles, and to take advantage of Hibernate's SQL generation and caching strategies.

Keywords like SELECT, FROM, and WHERE, etc., are not case sensitive, but properties like table and column names are case sensitive in HQL.

5) What are the directives in JSP?

=)
In JSP, directives are special instructions that provide global settings for the page. They include "page" for page-level attributes, "include" for file inclusion, "taglib" for importing tag libraries, "import" for importing Java classes, "extends" for specifying superclass, "session" for session management, "buffer" for output buffering, "info" for page information, "errorPage" for error handling, and "contentType" for response MIME type. These directives control translation, execution, and response generation, and are placed at the beginning of the JSP file.

6) What is networking?
=)
Java Networking is a concept of connecting two or more computing devices together so that we can share resources.

Java socket programming provides facility to share data between different computing devices.

	Advantage of Java Networking
		Sharing resources
		Centralize software management

The java.net package supports two protocols,

TCP: Transmission Control Protocol provides reliable communication between the sender and receiver. TCP is used along with the Internet Protocol referred as TCP/IP.
UDP: User Datagram Protocol provides a connection-less protocol service by allowing packet of data to be transferred along two or more nodes

7)Write the method for creating connection?
=)
Register the driver class
The forName() method of Class class is used to register the driver class. This method is used to dynamically load the driver class.
Syntax of forName() method
public static void forName(String className)throws ClassNotFound

Create the connection object
The getConnection() method of DriverManager class is used to establish connection with the database.
Syntax of getConnection() method
1) public static Connection getConnection(String url)throws SQLException  
2) public static Connection getConnection(String url,String name,String password)  
throws SQLException  

Create the Statement object
The createStatement() method of Connection interface is used to create statement. The object of statement is responsible to execute queries with the database.
Syntax of createStatement() method
public Statement createStatement()throws SQLException  

Execute the query
The executeQuery() method of Statement interface is used to execute queries to the database. This method returns the object of ResultSet that can be used to get all the records of a table.
Syntax of executeQuery() method
public ResultSet executeQuery(String sql)throws SQLException

Close the connection object
By closing connection object statement and ResultSet will be closed automatically. The close() method of Connection interface is used to close the connection.
Syntax of close() method
public void close()throws SQLException  
8) What is the yield ( ) method?
=)
A yield() method is a static method of Thread class and it can stop the currently executing thread and will give a chance to other waiting threads of the same priority. If in case there are no waiting threads or if all the waiting threads have low priority then the same thread will continue its execution. The advantage of yield() method is to get a chance to execute other waiting threads so if our current thread takes more time to execute and allocate processor to other threads.

Syntax:
public static void yield()
9) What is the use of socket class?
=)
The java.net.Socket class allows us to create socket objects that help us in implementing all fundamental socket operations. We can perform various networking operations such as sending, reading data and closing connections. Each Socket object that has been created using with java.net.Socket class has been associated exactly with 1 remote host, for connecting to another different host, we must create a new socket object.

10) What is servlet?
=)
A servlet can be described in various ways depending on the context. It is a technology used to create web applications and an API that provides many interfaces and classes, including documentation. As an interface, it must be implemented to create any servlet. It is also a class that extends the capabilities of servers and responds to incoming requests, capable of responding to any request. Additionally, a servlet is a web component that is deployed on the server to create dynamic web pages.
Q2)
1)Explain in details directives in JSP.
=)
Directives in JSP (JavaServer Pages) are special instructions that provide guidance to the JSP container on how to process the page. They are used to configure settings, import classes, define error handling, and more. There are three types of directives in JSP: page directive, include directive, and taglib directive. Here's a detailed explanation of each directive:

1. Page Directive:
The page directive is used to define attributes and configuration settings for the entire JSP page. It is typically placed at the beginning of the JSP file and is enclosed within `<%@ %>`. Some common attributes of the page directive include:

- `language`: Specifies the scripting language used in the JSP page (e.g., Java).
- `contentType`: Sets the MIME type of the response sent to the client (e.g., text/html).
- `import`: Imports Java classes that are needed in the JSP page.
- `session`: Specifies whether the JSP page participates in maintaining session state.
- `errorPage`: Specifies the error handling page for handling exceptions thrown during the JSP page execution.

Example:
```jsp
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" import="java.util.List" session="false" errorPage="/error.jsp" %>
```

2. Include Directive:
The include directive is used to include the content of another file in the current JSP page during the translation phase. It allows code reuse and modularization. The content of the included file is inserted at the specified location in the JSP file. The syntax for the include directive is `<%@ include file="filename.jsp" %>`, where the `file` attribute specifies the path to the included file.

Example:
```jsp
<%@ include file="header.jsp" %>
```

3. Taglib Directive:
The taglib directive is used to declare and define custom tag libraries that can be used in the JSP page. It provides access to custom tags that encapsulate reusable functionality and can be used to simplify the JSP code. The taglib directive is typically placed at the beginning of the JSP file and has the following syntax: `<%@ taglib uri="URI" prefix="prefix" %>`, where `URI` specifies the location of the tag library descriptor (TLD) file and `prefix` is the prefix used to identify and invoke the tags from the library.

Example:
```jsp
<%@ taglib uri="http://example.com/custom" prefix="custom" %>
```
2) Explain inter thread communication with an example.
=)

Inter-thread communication or Co-operation is all about allowing synchronized threads to communicate with each other.

Cooperation (Inter-thread communication) is a mechanism in which a thread is paused running in its critical section and another thread is allowed to enter (or lock) in the same critical section to be executed.It is implemented by following methods of Object class:

wait()
notify()
notifyAll()
1) wait() method
The wait() method causes current thread to release the lock and wait until either another thread invokes the notify() method or the notifyAll() method for this object, or a specified amount of time has elapsed.

The current thread must own this object's monitor, so it must be called from the synchronized method only otherwise it will throw exception.

2) notify() method
The notify() method wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor. If any threads are waiting on this object, one of them is chosen to be awakened. The choice is arbitrary and occurs at the discretion of the implementation.

Syntax:

public final void notify()  
3) notifyAll() method
Wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor.

Syntax:

public final void notifyAll() 

Example
```java
class Customer{    
int amount=10000;    
    
synchronized void withdraw(int amount){    
System.out.println("going to withdraw...");    
    
if(this.amount<amount){    
System.out.println("Less balance; waiting for deposit...");    
try{wait();}catch(Exception e){}    
}    
this.amount-=amount;    
System.out.println("withdraw completed...");    
}    
    
synchronized void deposit(int amount){    
System.out.println("going to deposit...");    
this.amount+=amount;    
System.out.println("deposit completed... ");    
notify();    
}    
}    
    
class Test{    
public static void main(String args[]){    
final Customer c=new Customer();    
new Thread(){    
public void run(){c.withdraw(15000);}    
}.start();    
new Thread(){    
public void run(){c.deposit(10000);}    
}.start();    
    
}}    
```

3) Differentiate between statement and prepared statement interface.
=)

Statement Interface:

1. Purpose:
   - Executes static SQL statements without input parameters.

2. Execution:
   - SQL statements are compiled and executed each time they are executed.

3. Performance:
   - Slower performance due to compilation at execution time.

4. Security:
   -b Prone to SQL injection attacks.

5. Usage:
   - For executing simple SQL queries that do not require parameters.

6. Syntax:
   - Uses concatenation to build SQL queries.

7. Parameterization:
   - Not supported.

PreparedStatement Interface:

1. Purpose:
   - Executes parameterized SQL statements.

2. Execution:
   - SQL statements are precompiled and can be executed multiple times with different parameters.

3. Performance:
   - Faster performance as the statement is precompiled.

4. Security:
   - Provides better security against SQL injection attacks.

5. Usage:
   - For executing SQL queries with parameters.

6. Syntax:
   - Uses placeholders (`?`) for parameters in SQL queries.

7. Parameterization:
   - Supports parameter binding with various data types.
 
4)Explain the life cycle of thread.
=)
In Java, the life cycle of a thread follows a similar pattern as described earlier. Let's look at the thread life cycle in Java:

1. New/Creation: The thread is created by instantiating a class that extends the `Thread` class or implements the `Runnable` interface. The thread is in the new state, and the necessary system resources are allocated for it.

2. Runnable: After the thread is created, it can be started by calling the `start()` method. The thread enters the runnable state, indicating that it is ready for execution. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) will schedule the thread for execution based on its internal algorithms.

3. Running: When the JVM selects the thread from the runnable pool, it enters the running state. The `run()` method of the thread is invoked, and the thread's code starts executing.

4. Blocked/Waiting: A running thread can enter the blocked or waiting state due to several reasons. For example, it might need to acquire a lock that is currently held by another thread or wait for a certain condition to be met. The thread can explicitly enter the blocked state by calling methods such as `sleep()`, `wait()`, or `join()`. It can also be blocked by I/O operations or synchronization mechanisms. While in the blocked state, the thread temporarily gives up the CPU and waits for the necessary resources or conditions to become available.

5. Timed Waiting: Similar to the blocked state, a thread can enter the timed waiting state by invoking methods such as `sleep()` or `wait()` with a specific timeout period. The thread waits for the specified time before resuming execution or until it is interrupted.

6. Terminated/Dead: A thread reaches the terminated or dead state when its `run()` method completes execution or when an uncaught exception is thrown within the thread. Once a thread is terminated, it cannot be restarted or resumed.

It's important to note that in Java, thread states are managed by the JVM and the underlying operating system. Java provides various methods and classes in the `java.lang.Thread` and `java.util.concurrent` packages to control thread behavior and synchronization. Developers should handle thread synchronization, communication, and coordination carefully to ensure thread safety and avoid race conditions or deadlocks.   
5) Explain methods of serversocket class with syntax.
=)
The ServerSocket class in Java is used to create a server-side socket that listens for incoming client connections. It provides methods for accepting client connections, obtaining client information, and managing the server socket. Here are the commonly used methods of the ServerSocket class along with their syntax:

ServerSocket(int port):

Syntax: ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);
Description: Constructs a new ServerSocket instance that binds to the specified port on the local machine.

Socket accept():

Syntax: Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();
Description: Listens for a client connection and blocks until a client connects to the server socket. It returns a Socket object representing the client connection.

void close():

Syntax: serverSocket.close();
Description: Closes the server socket and releases any associated system resources.

int getLocalPort():

Syntax: int port = serverSocket.getLocalPort();
Description: Returns the local port number to which the server socket is bound.

InetAddress getInetAddress():

Syntax: InetAddress address = serverSocket.getInetAddress();
Description: Returns the local InetAddress to which the server socket is bound.

boolean isClosed():

Syntax: boolean closed = serverSocket.isClosed();
Description: Checks whether the server socket is closed or not. Returns true if the socket is closed; otherwise, returns false.

boolean isBound():

Syntax: boolean bound = serverSocket.isBound();
Description: Checks whether the server socket is bound to a specific local port or not. Returns true if the socket is bound; otherwise, returns false.

Q3)

1) What is the difference between execute ( ), executeQuery ( ) and

executeupdate ( )?
=)
execute():

Executes any SQL statement (DDL or DML)
Returns a boolean indicating the execution status
Can be used for any type of SQL statement
Suitable for statements that return a result set or update count
Provides versatility in executing various SQL statements
executeQuery():

Executes a SELECT SQL statement and returns a ResultSet
Returns a ResultSet object containing the query result
Specifically used for SELECT statements
Suitable for statements that retrieve data
executeUpdate():

Executes an SQL statement (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
Returns the number of affected rows as an int
Specifically used for modifying statements
Suitable for statements that modify the database

2) Explain an architecture of hibernate
=)
Hibernate is an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for Java that simplifies the interaction between Java applications and relational databases. It provides a high-level abstraction layer for database operations, allowing developers to work with objects instead of writing native SQL queries. The architecture of Hibernate consists of several key components:

Application Layer:

The application layer represents the Java application that utilizes Hibernate for database operations.
It consists of application-specific classes, such as entities, value objects, and data access objects (DAOs).
Hibernate Configuration:

The Hibernate configuration specifies the settings and properties required for Hibernate to connect to the database.
It includes details such as the database connection URL, credentials, and dialect.
SessionFactory:

The SessionFactory is a thread-safe object that is responsible for creating and managing sessions.
It is built based on the configuration settings and provides a factory pattern for creating Session objects.
Session:

A Session represents a single unit of work and acts as an interface between the application and the database.
It provides methods for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and querying the database.
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Layer:

The ORM layer maps Java objects to database tables and handles the conversion between the two.
It utilizes Hibernate's annotations or XML mapping files to define the mappings between entities and database tables.
Transaction Management:

Hibernate supports transaction management to ensure data consistency and integrity.
It allows developers to manage transactions explicitly using the begin, commit, and rollback operations.
Query Language:

Hibernate provides Hibernate Query Language (HQL) and Criteria API to query the database.
HQL is a SQL-like language that operates on persistent entities and their properties.
The Criteria API provides a type-safe and object-oriented way to build queries programmatically.
Database:

The database represents the underlying relational database system that Hibernate interacts with.
Hibernate abstracts the database-specific details and provides a consistent API to work with different databases.

3) Explain methods of socket class with example.

=)
The Socket class in Java is used to create a client-side socket that connects to a server socket. It provides methods for establishing a connection, sending and receiving data, and managing the socket. Here are some commonly used methods of the Socket class with examples:

Socket(String host, int port):

This constructor creates a new socket and connects it to the specified host and port.
Example: Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 8080);
InputStream getInputStream():

This method returns the input stream associated with the socket, allowing data to be read from the socket.
Example: InputStream inputStream = socket.getInputStream();
OutputStream getOutputStream():

This method returns the output stream associated with the socket, allowing data to be written to the socket.
Example: OutputStream outputStream = socket.getOutputStream();
void close():

This method closes the socket and releases any associated system resources.
Example: socket.close();
InetAddress getInetAddress():

This method returns the remote IP address to which the socket is connected.
Example: InetAddress address = socket.getInetAddress();
int getPort():

This method returns the remote port number to which the socket is connected.
Example: int port = socket.getPort();
void setSoTimeout(int timeout):

This method sets the timeout value for blocking operations (such as reading or writing) on the socket.
Example: socket.setSoTimeout(5000);

socket class example

import java.io.*;
import java.net.Socket;

public class SocketExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = "localhost";
        int port = 8080;

        try {
            // Create a new socket and connect to the server
            Socket socket = new Socket(host, port);

            // Get the input and output streams for the socket
            InputStream inputStream = socket.getInputStream();
            OutputStream outputStream = socket.getOutputStream();

            // Write data to the server
            String message = "Hello, Server!";
            outputStream.write(message.getBytes());

            // Read data from the server
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream));
            String response = reader.readLine();
            System.out.println("Server response: " + response);

            // Close the socket
            socket.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


4)Write a JSP program to accept Name & age of voter and check whether he/she is eligible for voting or not
=)

            // Execute the SQL statement to delete the records
            int rowsAffected = statement.executeUpdate("DELETE FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'A%'");

            // Print the number of deleted records
            System.out.println("Number of records deleted: " + rowsAffected);
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();

Q4)
1)Write advantages and disadvantages of spring
=)
Spring is a lightweight Java framework that provides features like dependency injection, inversion of control, aspect-oriented programming, and seamless integration with other technologies, making it easier to develop and manage enterprise applications.

Advantages of Spring in Java:

Lightweight and follows the "POJO" principle.
Powerful Dependency Injection (DI) mechanism.
Inversion of Control (IoC) simplifies object creation.
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) for modularizing cross-cutting concerns.
Seamless integration with other frameworks and technologies.
Excellent testability with support for testing frameworks.

Disadvantages of Spring in Java:

Steep learning curve due to the comprehensive nature of the framework.
Configuration complexity, especially in large-scale applications.
Overhead compared to bare-bones Java code.
Legacy reliance on XML configuration (though modern versions offer alternatives).
Flexibility can lead to misuse and unnecessary complexity.
Potential compatibility issues when upgrading to new versions.


2) Explain JSP tags with example.
=)
JSP (JavaServer Pages) tags are special constructs used in JSP files to execute Java code, control the flow of the page, and generate dynamic content. There are three types of JSP tags: directive tags, scripting tags, and action tags.

Directive Tags: Directive tags provide instructions to the JSP container for processing the JSP page. They are used to import packages, set character encoding, define error pages, etc. The commonly used directive tags are:
<%@ page %>: Specifies page-specific attributes like language, content type, etc.
<%@ include %>: Includes the content of another file during JSP translation.
<%@ taglib %>: Declares and imports custom tag libraries.
Example of a directive tag:

  
  
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" pageEncoding="UTF-8" %>
Scripting Tags: Scripting tags allow embedding Java code directly within the JSP page. They are used to execute logic, define variables, and perform computations. The commonly used scripting tags are:
<% %>: Executes Java code without any output.
<%= %>: Evaluates the expression and inserts its value into the response.
Example of a scripting tag:

  

  
<%
    String name = "John";
    int age = 30;
    %>

<p>Welcome, <%= name %>. Your age is <%= age %>.</p>
Action Tags: Action tags are used to perform specific actions like controlling flow, manipulating data, or interacting with JavaBeans. They are represented by <jsp:...> tags. Commonly used action tags include:
<jsp:forward>: Forwards the request to another resource.
<jsp:include>: Includes the content of another resource in the response.
<jsp:useBean>: Instantiates a JavaBean for use in the JSP.
<jsp:setProperty>: Sets properties of a JavaBean.
Example of an action tag:

  
  
<jsp:useBean id="person" class="com.example.Person" />
<jsp:setProperty name="person" property="name" value="John" />

<p>Welcome, ${person.name}.</p>
3)What are the advantages and disadvantages of multithreading?
=)
Multithreading in Java enables concurrent execution of multiple threads within a program. It allows for parallel processing, efficient resource utilization, and improved performance. By dividing tasks into separate threads, Java programs can handle multiple operations simultaneously, enhancing responsiveness and scalability. Multithreading is a key feature in Java for developing efficient and concurrent applications.
the advantages and disadvantages of multithreading 

Advantages:
1. Improved Performance: Multithreading enables concurrent execution, maximizing resource utilization and enhancing overall program performance.
2. Responsiveness: Multithreading allows a program to remain responsive during time-consuming tasks by executing them concurrently.
3. Resource Sharing: Threads within a process can share memory, facilitating efficient data and resource sharing.
4. Simplified Design: Multithreading simplifies complex systems by decomposing them into manageable threads, improving understandability and maintainability.

Disadvantages:
1. Complexity: Multithreading introduces complexity due to considerations like thread synchronization, race conditions, and deadlocks.
2. Increased Resource Consumption: Managing multiple threads requires additional system resources, potentially impacting overall performance.
3. Synchronization Overhead: Ensuring thread-safe access to shared data introduces synchronization overhead and can reduce scalability.
4. Difficult Debugging: Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging due to non-deterministic behavior and issues like race conditions.
5. Potential for Thread Interference: Improper synchronization can lead to thread interference, causing unpredictable and incorrect results.

1)Run method
=)
The `run()` method in Java is a crucial part of concurrent programming and multithreading. Here's a description of the `run()` method:

The `run()` method is a member function defined in the `Runnable` interface and is used to specify the code that will be executed by a thread. It is where the actual logic or task of the thread is defined. The `run()` method does not take any arguments and does not return a value.

When a thread is started by invoking the `start()` method, it internally calls the `run()` method, executing the code within it. Multiple threads can run concurrently, each executing their own `run()` method.

It is important to note that the `run()` method should be overridden in a class that implements the `Runnable` interface or extends the `Thread` class. The specific code or actions that need to be performed by the thread are implemented within the `run()` method.

Once the execution of the `run()` method completes, the thread terminates, and its resources are released.

Overall, the `run()` method plays a vital role in defining the behavior and actions of a thread in Java's multithreading environment.

2) Statement interface
=)
The `Statement` interface in Java is a vital component of the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API, enabling the execution of SQL statements and interaction with databases. Here's a concise description of the `Statement` interface:

The `Statement` interface in Java represents a SQL statement sent to a database for execution, acting as a bridge between a Java application and a database server.

It allows for the execution of SQL statements such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` against a database.

Using the `executeQuery()` method, the `Statement` interface retrieves a result set containing data obtained from the executed query.

Batch updates are supported by the `Statement` interface, enabling the execution of multiple SQL statements as a single unit for improved performance.

Parameterized queries can be utilized with the `Statement` interface, allowing dynamic setting of parameter values for secure and efficient query execution.

Overall, the `Statement` interface plays a crucial role in JDBC, facilitating SQL statement execution, result retrieval, and enabling database interaction for Java applications.

3)HttpServlet.

`HttpServlet` is a class in Java that provides the foundation for creating web applications using the HTTP protocol. Here's a concise description of `HttpServlet`:

1. `HttpServlet` is a class in the `javax.servlet.http` package that extends the `GenericServlet` class and specializes in handling HTTP requests and responses.
2. It acts as a base class for creating servlets that can respond to HTTP-specific methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.
3. Servlets extending `HttpServlet` must override the `doGet()` or `doPost()` methods to provide the specific logic for handling the corresponding HTTP requests.
4. `HttpServlet` provides built-in methods like `doHead()`, `doOptions()`, `doPut()`, `doDelete()`, etc., that can be overridden to handle respective HTTP methods.
5. It allows access to request and response objects, enabling manipulation of headers, parameters, cookies, and other aspects of the HTTP request and response cycle.
6. `HttpServlet` is a critical component of Java's Servlet API, allowing developers to build web applications that can handle HTTP requests and generate appropriate responses.
